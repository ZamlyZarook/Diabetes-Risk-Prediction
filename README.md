# 🩺 Predicting the Risk of Diabetes – ML Project

This application employs machine learning techniques to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health indicators such as age, BMI, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and other relevant features.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning module in my BSc (Hons) in Information Technology degree program. It demonstrates the practical application of supervised learning models to real-world healthcare data to identify individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes.

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
**[Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)**  
It includes anonymized patient records with features like age, gender, BMI, and medical history.

## ⚙️ Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training with multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of predictions and performance metrics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
